# reddit-app

Here is a small React Native CLI project (for Android) I did based on Reddit webapp using its official API.
The app provides reddit posts filtered by "Hot", "Controversial", "New" and "Top" tags.

Each post, when clicked, will also display a WebView retrieving the post's endpoint.
Some extra features are: Dynamic pagination, usage of FlatList and usage of font-awesome icons.
